Shin-Dor Soccer

- 2 Player game where one needs to score 4 goals to win.
	- Main focus of the code was implementation of collisions, conservation of energy, and artificial intelligence.
	 -It has a 2 player mode where 2 players can play in the same keyboard.
	- It also has a single player mode where you play against an AI in which you can pick an easy or hard difficulty.
	- You can pick up powers that are super jump or extra speed. Keep in mind powers are cumulative and once you reach the max 		  attribute of extra speed or extra jump you will not be able to collect more powers of those.
	- It has an Instructions screen that you can read.
	- Leaderboard in which scores are stored in a file called "Leaderboard" (txt file) and the top 3 scores will be displayed. 

- Run the project using the file ShinDorSoccerCode.py.
